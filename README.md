# google_homepage

I've created a clone of the Google homepage using HTML and CSS. I feel that it is pretty close but there are several issues. Font-style, colors, and content spacing are all a little off. The main problem that I have left for later is that on resizing the page the logo will overlap the search bar and stay there until refreshed.
